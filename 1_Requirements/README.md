## WIPER CONTROL
Working windshield wipers are vital for driver visibility. The vehicle is considered unsafe if the wipers don't work.The front wiper motor and the wiper transmission mechanism (linkage) are installed below the windshield, under the cowl panel cover.

# WORKING PROCESS
*   When the button is pressed ONCE, the car will be on ACC mode.
*   When the button is pressed TWICE, the car will be on Ignition mode.
*   When the button is pressed THREE times, wiper turn on.
*   When the button is pressed FOUR times, wiper turn off.

## SWOT Analysis

*   Strength
 
    Visibility
    The wiper does not stop in the middle of the window during drive.
    Safety
       
*   Weakness
      
    High cost
    Not automatic

*   Threats

    Once the board repaired cannot be replaced quickly

*   What
        
     Wipers system are operated by an electric motor. The electric motor is attached to a worm gear, 
     which transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion.

*   Why
 
     The main purpose of the wiper system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.

*   When

     American inventor Mary Anderson received credit for the first operational windshield wiper, back in 1903. Anderson's “window cleaning device” used a rubber squeegee blade on an arm, operated via a hand-cranked lever from inside the vehicle.

*   Where
     
     Wipers system can be activated by a lever located to the right of the steering wheel. Pulling the lever down should activate the windshield wipers on their lowest setting

*   How

     When we turn the wiper on, the wiper switch sends the signal to the control module. The control module operates the wiper relay. The relay sends 12-volt power to the wiper motor.
