## CAR WIPER CONTROL
*   Windshield wipers keep the windshield of a vehicle clear from rain water, snow, dust and road spray. The first windshield wipers were operated manually by moving a lever inside the car. Later wiper designs were powered by the engine's manifold vacuum. Virtually all wipers today employ an electric motor coupled with a linkage mechanism and are actuated by a knob beside the steering wheel.
*   The wiper blade speed can be adjusted by the driver.A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor (30) detecting rain conditions to produce . an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions.
*   Working windshield wipers are vital for driver visibility. The vehicle is considered unsafe if the wipers don't work. The front wiper motor and the wiper transmission mechanism (linkage) are installed below the windshield, under the cowl panel cover.

# WORKING PROCESS
*   When the button is pressed ONCE, the car will be on ACC mode.
*   When the button is pressed TWICE, the car will be on Ignition mode.
*   When the button is pressed THREE times, wiper turn on.
*   When the button is pressed FOUR times, wiper turn off.

## SWOT Analysis

*   Strength
 
    Visibility
    The wiper does not stop in the middle of the window during drive.
    Safety
       
*   Weakness
      
    High cost
    Not automatic

*   Threats

    Once the board repaired cannot be replaced quickly
